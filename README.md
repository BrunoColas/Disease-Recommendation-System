This project is a Disease Prediction System developed using Support vector machine algorithm having a accuracy >95%. The dataset is collected from Kaggle. 
The data had certain noisy data which is been managed using pandas, the data was then transformed into training and testing with birfucation of 80-20.
Other Classification algoithms such as Naive Bayes, Random forest classification and K-Nearest Neighbor was also applied to the dataset.
